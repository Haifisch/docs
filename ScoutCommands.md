# power

## power.ischarging()
Returns true/false if Scout is charging its battery via USB.

## power.percent()
Returns fuel gauge percentage of remaining battery life

## power.voltage()
Returns the current voltage of the battery (x100)

## power.enablevcc()
Enables the 3V3 pin on the header—used to supply backpacks with power.

## power.disablevcc()
Disables the 3V3 pin on the header—used to supply backpacks with power.

## power.sleep(milliseconds)
Puts the Scout to sleep for *milliseconds*

## power.report()
Prints a JSON response of the power status of the Scout.
```
{
 "type":"power",
 "battery":100,
 "voltage":417,
 "charging":false,
 "vcc":true
}
```
Battery is percentage of power available, from 0-100%.  Voltage is the current battery voltage, x100—so 417 is 4.17 volts. Charging is true if the battery is currently charging, false otherwise.  VCC is true if the 3V3 pin that powers the backpacks is turned on, false otherwise.

# mesh

## mesh.config(scoutId, troopId, channel=20)
Set the mesh radio settings.  *scoutId* is the unique ID of this Scout for a given troop.  *troopId* is the Troop ID for all Scouts in this mesh network (also known as a PAN ID.)  *channel* is the 2.4GHz radio channel to use, and all Scouts in a troop should use the same channel.  The default channel is 20, and can be from 5-26.

## mesh.setpower(level)
Set the mesh radio power settings using the following map:

 * 0:   3.5 dBm
 * 1:   3.3 dBm
 * 2:   2.8 dBm
 * 3:   2.3 dBm
 * 4:   1.8 dBm
 * 5:   1.2 dBm
 * 6:   0.5 dBm
 * 7:  -0.5 dBm
 * 8:  -1.5 dBm
 * 9:  -2.5 dBm
 * 10: -3.5 dBm
 * 11: -4.5 dBm
 * 12: -6.5 dBm
 * 13: -8.5 dBm
 * 14: -11.5 dBm
 * 15: -16.5 dBm

## mesh.setdatarate(rate)
Set the mesh radio data rate, from 250kbit/sec up to 2Mbit/sec using the following map:

 * 0:    250 kb/s  | -100 dBm
 * 1:    500 kb/s  |  -96 dBm
 * 2:   1000 kb/s |  -94 dBm
 * 3:   2000 kb/s |  -86 dBm

The higher the speed chosen, the less signal sensitivity the radio has--which usually translates to less radio range in the real world.

## mesh.key(key)
Set the mesh radio security key, enabling the AES128 hardware encryption.  All Scouts in a troop should use the same key in order to communicate.  The key given should be 0-16 characters.

## mesh.resetkey()
Resets the mesh radio security key.

## mesh.joingroup(groupId)
Join this Scout to a mesh group

## mesh.leavegroup(groupId)
Remove this Scout from a mesh group

## mesh.ingroup(groupId)
Returns true/false if this Scout is in the group given

## mesh.ping(scoutId)
Ping another Scout in the mesh network.

## mesh.pinggroup(groupId)
Ping Scouts in an group. If available, at least one Scout will return a response.

## mesh.send(scoutId, message)
Send *message* to another Scout with ID of *scoutId*

## mesh.verbose(enabled)
Turn on/off verbose mesh radio debugging output

## mesh.report()
Prints a JSON response of the mesh radio status of the Scout.
```
{
 "type":"mesh",
 "scoutid":2,
 "troopid":1234,
 "routes":0,
 "channel":20,
 "rate":"250 kb/s",
 "power":"3.5 dBm"
}
```
## mesh.routing()
Prints a human-readable output of the current routing table for this Scout.

## mesh.announce(groupId, message)
Send *message* to an entire group at *groupId*

## mesh.signal()
Return the last received message’s signal strength (RSSI.)  Typical values returned will be somewhere between -30 and -95, with lower numbers being a lower signal.  Since they’re negative values, -95 is a weaker signal than -30.

## mesh.loss()
Return the last received message’s link quality indictator (LQI.)  Possible values are 0-255.  255 indicate no packet loss has occurred, and lower values indicate an increasing amount of packet loss is happening.
